# Swiss Plasma Center github organization

The [Swiss Plasma Center (SPC)](https://spc.epfl.ch) is a research center part of the [EPFL, Lausanne Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch)

The https://github.com/SwissPlasmaCenter centralizes the various open source developed and/or supported by the Swiss Plasma Center, using licenses from LGPL to MIT

A list of codes and their websites is also available at [SPC codes](https://spc.epfl.ch/codes), including codes not yet fully open source but with a simple agreement for collaboration.

Open source codes:

- [SCDDS: https://gitlab.epfl.ch/spc/scdds](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/spc/scdds) Simulink-based Control Design and Deployment Suite which is at the heart of the ITER PCS simulation platform [PCSSP](https://github.com/iterorganization/pcssp)

- [CHEASE https://gitlab.epfl.ch/spc/chease](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/spc/chease) Fixed boundary equilibrium code, see [https://spc.epfl.ch/chease](https://spc.epfl.ch/chease)

- [MEQ suite https://gitlab.epfl.ch/spc/tcv/meq](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/spc/tcv/meq) matlab free boundary equilibrium code

Soon to be open source officially:

- [Terpsichore ]() 3D MHD stability code

- [interpos https://gitlab.epfl.ch/spc/interpos](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/spc/interpos) linear, quadratic and cubic spline with tension library (can be used from fortran, C, idl, matlab, python, tdi...), see [https://crppwww.epfl.ch/~sauter/interpos](https://crppwww.epfl.ch/~sauter/interpos)
